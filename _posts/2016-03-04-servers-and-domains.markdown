What would be a web application without a server. First and one of the most important decisions in creating web application is a web host choice. We need to take into consideration many factors:

  * deployment options
  * price
  * scalability
  * security
  * hardware

There are many more like: good tech support, add-ons, email options or customer reviews.

We can distinguish few hosting types. Note: cons and pros listed below are not always a rule and moreover it is not comprehensive list. I pointed security issues where they can appear regardless of your tech skills. Also I didn't add middle points.

### Free hosting

Usually offered as trial or with meaningful limits.

Pros: It's free!! A good start point for a new app.

Cons: You can expect slow connection speed, server naps and sometimes banners with ads.

### Shared hosting

Pros: Low prices, good entry level option, easy to use and setup.

Cons: Shared resources - a physical server and the software applications. Possible bad performance and no control over performance. Security can be an issue.

### Virtual hosting

Similar to shared hosting but upgraded. A bridge between shared hosting and dedicated hosting.

Pros: Other websites will not affect yours.

Cons: Security can be an issue. Shared physical space.

### Dedicated hosting

Pros: You have the entire web server to yourself. Very good performance. Gives higher level of security. Offers unlimited bandwidth and disk space. Full control of server.

Cons: Cost. Requires extensive IT knowledge.


### Collocated hosting

It is like a hotel for servers ;)

Pros: Full control of what server you have and full control of it. Very good performance. Gives higher level of security.

Cons: Cost and maintenance. Requires extensive IT knowledge.

### Cloud hosting

Pros: Flexibility. Prices can be very good. Improved data recovery. You can buy resources per hour.

Cons: Security can be an issue. Possible bad performance. Tech support can be an issue. Harder to find source of bug or issue.

### Or...

You can be your own master and build your own server. I would consider this option to be rather for hobby purposes only :)
