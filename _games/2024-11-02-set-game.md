<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>The goal of the game is to find sets of three cards that form a set. A set is a group of three cards where each of the three features is either all the same or all different.</p>
<p>The features are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Number: 1, 2, or 3</li>
  <li>Shape: circle, rectangle, or triangle</li>
  <li>Color: red, black, or blue</li>
  <li>Shading: solid, striped, or open</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on three cards to see if they form a set. If you find a set, the cards will be removed from the grid.</p>
<p>If you are unable to find a set, you can click the "Hint" button to reveal one card that can form a set.</p>
<p>The game is won when all the cards have been removed from the grid or when you can't find any more sets.</p>
